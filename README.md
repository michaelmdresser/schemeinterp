# schemeinterp

This is my (very poor) attempt at walking along with Peter Norving's Lispy [1] implementation of Scheme. I chose to do it instead in go (at first) because that was the language I was working with at the time. Presumably I will make an implementation in other languages as well, given how simple it is. Please recognize that the odds are high that features are just missing.

### How to Run
```
cd scheme_go && go run main.go
```
